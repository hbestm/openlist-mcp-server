# Changelog

All notable changes to the OpenList MCP Server are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **`_list_items` missing import causes NameError**: `fs.py` and `advanced.py`
  called `_list_items()` without importing it. Extracting shared walker code
  in v0.3.2 omitted the import lines — any directory-traversal tool
  (`find_duplicates`, `tree`, `disk_usage`, `mirror`) would crash at runtime
  with `NameError: name '_list_items' is not defined`. Added `from . import
  _list_items` to both files. (`fs.py`, `advanced.py`)

### Changed (Cleanup)
- **`_human_size` deduplicated**: Two identical copies existed in `advanced.py`
  and `fs.py`. Moved to shared `_list_items` module in `tools/__init__.py`,
  both files now import it. Reduces duplicate code and ensures consistent
  formatting everywhere. (`__init__.py`, `advanced.py`, `fs.py`)
- **`import httpx` moved to module top**: Was inside a function body
  (`content_preview` tool), which causes repeated import overhead on each
  call and breaks PEP 8 conventions. Moved to module-level imports.
  (`advanced.py`)


## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-10

### Security
- **`update_current_user` bypasses `OPENLIST_READONLY`**: When the server is
  configured with `OPENLIST_READONLY=true`, this tool could still change
  passwords and base paths — a privilege escalation gap. Other write tools
  (`add_ssh_key`, `delete_ssh_key`) correctly called `enforce_writable()`,
  but `update_current_user` was missed. Now blocked like all other write
  operations. (`auth.py`)
- **`generate_torrent` bypasses `OPENLIST_READONLY`**: Generating `.torrent`
  files is a write operation (creates files on the server), but it lacked
  the `enforce_writable()` check. In readonly mode, the tool would silently
  proceed, potentially filling the server with torrent metadata files despite
  the readonly setting. (`advanced.py`)

### Fixed
- **`delete_share` sends wrong parameter format**: Used `params=` (query
  string) while all other share tools (`cancel_share`, `enable_share`,
  `disable_share`) use `json=` (request body). This is inconsistent — POST
  requests with query parameters may be ignored or rejected by the OpenList
  API, making `delete_share` silently fail while reporting success. The
  root cause was a copy-paste oversight when the tool was added in v0.2.8.
  (`share.py`)
- **`mirror` may fail on nested directories**: When syncing directory trees,
  files could be copied before their parent directories exist at the
  destination. The operation relied on CPython's dict insertion order
  (3.7+ behavior) rather than explicit ordering — if the API returns files
  before directories, the copy would fail with a "parent not found" error.
  Added `to_copy.sort()` to guarantee directories are always created first.
  (`fs.py`)
- **`tree` misidentifies files as directories on some API versions**: Used
  dict equality (`i not in dirs`) to distinguish files from directories,
  which depends on the entire dict object being identical — fragile across
  OpenList API versions. Changed to explicit type field check
  (`i.get("type") not in (1, "dir", "folder")`) which is robust against
  API response changes. (`fs.py`)

### Changed
- **Extracted shared `_list_items` helper**: 4 identical recursive directory
  walkers existed in `find_duplicates`, `tree`, `disk_usage`, and `mirror` —
  each with their own copy of the API call, error handling, and item parsing
  logic. A bug fix in one would easily be missed in another. Consolidated
  into a single `_list_items()` utility in `tools/__init__.py`, reducing
  ~50 lines of duplicate boilerplate and ensuring consistent behavior across
  all directory-traversal tools.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **`OPENLIST_SKILLS` environment variable**: Select which tool groups to load.
  - `core` (default) — 25 tools: auth + file browsing + upload/download
  - `default` — 44 tools: core + task management + shares
  - `all` — all 79 tools
  - Custom: `OPENLIST_SKILLS=fs,transfer,task`
- **Shared `skills.py` module**: Single source of truth for group metadata
  (`SKILL_GROUP_META`, `SKILL_PRESETS`, `resolve_skills()`, `count_tools()`).
- **Tests for skills module**: 21 test cases covering presets, resolution, counting, sync.
- **CI automation**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — ruff/mypy/pytest/coverage on push/PR.
- **Upgrade migration notice**: Banner and startup log prompt when only core tools are loaded.
- **Invalid group name warning**: `resolve_skills()` logs a warning for unrecognized group names.
- **`OPENLIST_SKILLS` in docs**: `.env.example`, README, README-zh updated.
- Startup banner now dynamically shows loaded groups and tool counts.

### Changed
- **Default loaded tools reduced from 79 to 25** (`OPENLIST_SKILLS=core`).
  Users who need all tools set `OPENLIST_SKILLS=all`.
- Auth/public tools are always loaded (login, SSH keys, profile update).
- `SKILL_GROUP_META`: removed hardcoded `count` field, uses `len()` dynamically.
- `__init__.py`: version now read dynamically from `pyproject.toml` (no static fallback).

### Fixed
- **401 auth bypass**: `request()` in `client.py` skipped authentication on the
  first attempt due to `attempt > 1` guard added with SQLITE_BUSY retry.
  `ensure_authenticated()` is now called once before the retry loop.

### Security
- **All confirm prompts** now prefixed with `⚠️` for better AI agent visibility:
  file delete, SSH key delete, settings save/delete, index operations,
  API token reset, share cancel/delete, task cancel/delete/batch ops.


## [0.2.12] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **SQLITE_BUSY auto-retry**: `OpenListClient.request()` now retries up to 3
  times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s) on SQLite database lock errors.
  All 79 tools benefit — no per-tool retry code needed.

### Fixed
- **Magnet links rejected** by SSRF protection: `magnet:` URLs are now allowed
  in `offline_download` and `batch_download`. SSRF check is skipped for magnet
  links (they have no hostname to resolve).
- **FTP/SFTP downloads blocked**: `ftp://` and `sftp://` URLs are now
  allowed alongside `http`/`https`/`magnet` in download tools. All
  hostname-based schemes still go through SSRF IP validation.

### Changed
- `_SAFE_SCHEMES` constant extracted at module top for single-source-of-truth
  on allowed download URL protocols: `http`, `https`, `magnet`, `ftp`, `sftp`.

## [0.2.11] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Admin search index management**: `build_search_index`, `update_search_index`,
  `stop_indexing`, `clear_search_index` — full lifecycle management of the search
  index (all require `confirm=true` for safety).
- **Admin settings write**: `save_settings` — update one or more global settings
  atomically; `delete_setting` — remove a custom setting (both require `confirm=true`).
- **Admin user management (read-only)**: `list_users` — list all user accounts with
  pagination; `get_user` — get detailed info for a specific user by ID.
- **Admin meta management (read-only)**: `list_metas` — list all metadata
  configurations; `get_meta` — get metadata details by ID.
- **Admin driver detail**: `list_drivers_detail` — list all storage drivers with
  full configuration templates (more detailed than `list_drivers`).
- **Admin token management**: `reset_api_token` — generate a new API token
  (requires `confirm=true`).
- 32 new tests covering all new tools (confirm gating, valid payloads, empty inputs).

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 67 to **79** across all categories.
- Startup banner updated with new admin tool listings.
- `admin.py` module evolved from read-only to hybrid read/write,
  importing `enforce_writable` and `validate_pagination`.

## [0.2.10] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- `list_tasks` now uses `GET` instead of `POST` for OpenList v4.2.2 compatibility
- Unit tests for `list_tasks` aligned with the new `GET` endpoint (all 72 tests passing)
- Startup banner tool count corrected from 65 to 67
- `__version__` NameError crash — added missing `from . import __version__` to `server.py`
- `mirror` pull mode now correctly copies files from dst to src (was wrongly copying src to dst, same as push)
- `_fetch_one` in `list_tasks(all)` now logs errors via `logger.warning` instead of silently swallowing them
- `delete_ssh_key` now requires `confirm=true` to prevent accidental deletion
- `add_ssh_key` now respects `OPENLIST_READONLY` via `enforce_writable`
- `update_share` uses `get_share_info` instead of pulling all 200 shares to find current files

### Changed
- HTTP connections now require explicit `OPENLIST_ALLOW_HTTP=true` — server rejects HTTP by default with a clear error message

### Infrastructure
- `import asyncio` in `task.py` and `import base64` in `advanced.py` moved from function body to module top
- Redundant `validate_path()` call removed from `get_archive_meta` (already inside `enforce_path_allowed`)

## [0.2.9] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- `get_archive_meta` — get archive metadata (format, encryption, comment, file tree) without extracting.
- `torrent_upload_parse` — parse a `.torrent` file via multipart form upload, returns info + reusable base64 data.
- `list_tasks(task_type="all")` — query all 6 task categories concurrently and merge results.

### Infrastructure
- `client.py`: add `multipart_form()` method for multipart/form-data POST requests.

## [0.2.8] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- `batch_cancel_tasks`, `batch_delete_tasks`, `batch_retry_tasks` — batch task operations.
- `clear_done_tasks`, `clear_succeeded_tasks`, `retry_failed_tasks` — one-shot task cleanup.
- `tree` — recursive directory tree with icons.
- `disk_usage` — disk usage summary by directory and file type.
- `find_duplicates` — detect duplicate files by name+size or size only.
- `content_preview` — preview text file content via range request.
- `batch_download` — download multiple URLs at once via offline download.
- `mirror` — recursive directory sync (push/pull/mirror modes, dry-run support).

### Added (Phase 3 — Read-only Admin)
- `list_storages`, `get_storage_info` — view storage backends (read-only).
- `list_drivers`, `get_driver_info` — view storage driver types.
- `get_settings`, `get_setting` — view global server settings (read-only).
- `get_index_progress` — view search index building progress.

### Added (Phase 4 — High-Frequency)
- `get_archive_extensions` — list supported archive formats.
- `get_share_info` — get details of a single share link.
- `list_my_ssh_keys`, `add_ssh_key`, `delete_ssh_key` — SSH public key management.
- `update_current_user` — update password or base path.
- `remove_empty_dirs` tool — recursively remove empty directories after cleanup operations.
- `update_share` tool — modify existing share links (password, expiration, files, etc.).
- `enable_share` / `disable_share` tools — temporarily toggle share links without deleting them.
- `parse_torrent` tool — parse `.torrent` file content (base64) and return file list/metadata.
- `generate_torrent` tool — generate a `.torrent` file for an existing file on the server.
- `torrent_rapid_upload` tool — attempt server-side rapid import from torrent data (requires CAS).

### Changed
- `create_share` now uses `files: list[str]` instead of `path: str` — OpenList v4.2.2 API requires a file list.
- `cancel_share` now calls `/share/disable` internally (the old `/share/cancel` endpoint no longer exists).
- `delete_share` now uses query parameter `?id=` instead of JSON body — matches OpenList v4.2.2 API.
- Startup guide updated from 32 to 40 tools.

### Fixed
- `search_files` parameter names corrected to match OpenList API:
  `path` → `parent`, `keyword` → `keywords`, added `scope` parameter.
  (PR #3 by @chung1912)
- Fixed 3 runtime crashes: missing `OpenListError` import, undefined `_human_size` function,
  and `request()` json parameter type annotation.
- Code quality: removed dead code, fixed ruff warnings, resolved mypy type errors.
- All source files reformatted with `ruff format`.
- `create_share` no longer returns "must add at least 1 object" error (was sending wrong payload format).
- `cancel_share` / `delete_share` no longer return 500 errors on OpenList v4.2.2.

### Security
- SSRF prevention: `offline_download` now resolves hostnames via DNS and blocks requests to
  private/internal IP ranges (127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16,
  169.254.0.0/16, ::1/128, fc00::/7, fe80::/10).
- `upload_file` now enforces a 100 MB limit on base64 content to prevent memory exhaustion.
- `copy`/`move` tools now check `enforce_writable` before `enforce_path_allowed` to prevent
  information leakage in readonly mode.
- `server.py` version string is now dynamically read from `__version__` instead of hardcoded.

## [0.2.7] — 2025-05-30

### Added
- `list_download_tools` tool — query available offline download tools (aria2, Transmission,
  qBittorrent, etc.) configured on the OpenList server.
- `OPENLIST_TOTP_SECRET` environment variable — auto-generate TOTP codes during login.
  When configured, 2FA is handled automatically without manual code input. (PR #2 by @chung1912)

### Changed
- `offline_download` docstring updated to document all supported download tools.
- Startup guide updated to reflect 32 tools across all categories.

### Fixed
- `validate_path`: component-level `..` detection — no longer rejects legitimate filenames
  like `backup..2024.tar.gz`.

## [0.2.6] — 2025-05-30

### Added
- `tools/advanced.py` module with:
  - `offline_download` — download files from a remote URL directly to the OpenList server
    (requires aria2, Transmission, or qBittorrent configured on the server).
  - `decompress_archive` — decompress archives (zip, rar, 7z, tar.gz, etc.) on the server.
  - `get_me` — get current authenticated user's profile.
  - `logout` — logout and invalidate the current authentication token.
  - `recursive_move` — recursively move an entire directory tree without listing individual file names.

### Changed
- Startup guide updated to list all 26 tools with categories.

## [0.2.5] — 2025-05-29

### Added
- **2FA/TOTP support**: `login()` tool accepts optional `otp_code` parameter for
  two-factor authentication.
- `upload_local_file` tool — upload a local file path directly without base64 encoding.
  Gated behind `OPENLIST_LOCAL_UPLOAD_ROOTS` environment variable.

### Changed
- Improved large file uploads: async chunked streaming (1MB chunks) instead of single `read_bytes()`.
- Write timeout increased to 120s.
- Version unification: `__version__` reads from package metadata at runtime.
  All version references consistent at v0.2.5.

### Fixed
- `validate_name()` now correctly allows filenames containing `..` patterns
  (e.g. `backup..tar.gz`, `..hidden_file`), only rejecting `.` and `..` as directory names.
- Installation guide corrected for source archive method.

### Security
- Base64 decode exception narrowed from `except Exception` to `(ValueError, binascii.Error)`.
- `OPENLIST_LOCAL_UPLOAD_ROOTS` restriction for local file uploads — disabled by default.

### Removed
- Automatic PyPI publishing from release workflow. Tag push creates a GitHub Release
  with build artifacts only.

## [0.2.4] — 2025-05-28

### Added
- **2FA / TOTP login support**: `login()` tool now accepts an optional `otp_code` parameter.
  When the OpenList account has 2FA enabled, the agent prompts the user for a TOTP code.

### Security
- HTTP warning for plain text credential transmission when using `http://` URLs.

## [0.2.3] — 2025-05-27

### Added
- `upload_local_file` tool (gated behind `OPENLIST_LOCAL_UPLOAD_ROOTS`).
- `OPENLIST_READONLY` environment variable — blocks all write/high-impact operations.
- `OPENLIST_ALLOWED_PATHS` environment variable — restricts MCP path operations to approved directories.
- Support for pagination parameters (`page`, `per_page`) in list operations.

### Security
- `upload_local_file` now requires explicit `OPENLIST_LOCAL_UPLOAD_ROOTS` configuration.
- HTTP transport warning when using plain `http://` URLs.

## [0.2.2] — 2025-05-26
